// Script-detection helpers for off-language gating.

// IMPORTANT (was previously documented wrong): Deepgram's realtime connection is
// FORCED to the source language (e.g. language=ar) — `language=multi` does NOT
// support Arabic, so it can't be used for the primary RTL case (see
// src/app/api/deepgram/route.ts). Under a forced source language Deepgram
// TRANSLITERATES off-language speech into the source script (English "okay" →
// "اوكي"), so a transliterated English aside is ~100% source-script and this
// ratio gate does NOT catch it — the active off-language defense is the LLM's
// transliteration/noise verdict in /api/translate. This gate still (a) catches
// the cases where Deepgram DOES emit Latin text in an RTL session, and (b) must
// FAIL-OPEN: it counts letters only, so valid Arabic containing digits (Hijri
// years, ayah/hadith numbers) is never wrongly dropped.
//
// Used both client-side (instant drop in use-deepgram, before a segment renders)
// and server-side (the noise filter in /api/translate, as a backstop).
