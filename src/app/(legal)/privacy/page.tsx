      <p style={styles.p}>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Tarjuman (&quot;Tarjuman&quot;,
        &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) collects, uses, shares, and protects
        information when you use the Tarjuman service (the &quot;Service&quot;) at
        tarjuman.live. By using the Service, you agree to this policy.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>What we collect</h2>
      <ul style={styles.ul}>
        <li>
          <strong>Account information:</strong> your email address, and your
          name and profile picture if you sign in with Google.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audio you record:</strong> when you start a session, your
          microphone audio is streamed to our speech-to-text provider (Deepgram)
          for live transcription. Audio is processed in transit and is{" "}
          <strong>not stored</strong> by us — only the resulting text is saved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transcripts, translations &amp; summaries:</strong> the
          source-language text from your recordings, the translations, and any
          AI summaries you generate. These are stored in our database and are
          visible only to your authenticated account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preferences:</strong> your default languages and display
          settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diagnostics &amp; usage:</strong> aggregate, non-identifying
          metrics (page views, error reports, counts of API calls) used to keep
          the Service running and catch bugs. These do not include your
          transcript content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Third-party processors</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        We share data with the following subprocessors only as needed to run the
        Service. Each handles data under its own privacy policy:
      </p>
      <ul style={styles.ul}>
        <li>
          <strong>Deepgram</strong> — real-time speech-to-text. Your audio is
          sent to Deepgram for transcription and returned as text.{" "}
          <a href="https://deepgram.com/privacy" style={{ color: COLORS.accent }}>
            Policy
          </a>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anthropic (Claude)</strong> — translation and summarization.
          Transcript text is sent to Anthropic&apos;s API. Anthropic does not
          train its models on API data by default.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy" style={{ color: COLORS.accent }}>
            Policy

          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Convex</strong> — our database and authentication backend.
          Stores your account, transcripts, summaries, and preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vercel</strong> — hosts the web app and provides cookieless,
          aggregate usage analytics (e.g. page views). No cross-site tracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sentry</strong> — error monitoring. To diagnose crashes it may
          process technical data such as your IP address, browser, and device
          type. It does not receive your transcripts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resend</strong> — sends transactional email (password-reset
          codes only).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google</strong> — only if you choose to sign in with Google
          (OAuth). We receive your name, email, and profile picture.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>How we use your data</h2>
      <ul style={styles.ul}>
        <li>To provide transcription, translation, and summary features.</li>
        <li>To let you access your transcript history across devices.</li>
        <li>To send transactional email (password reset).</li>
        <li>To monitor, secure, and improve the Service and prevent abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data, share it for
        advertising, or use your transcripts to train our own models. We share
        data only with the subprocessors above, for the purposes described.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>AI-generated content</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        Transcriptions, translations, and summaries are generated by automated
        systems and <strong>may contain errors</strong>. For religious content
        such as khutbahs, Qur&apos;an, or Hadith, treat the output as an aid
        only — not an authoritative translation or ruling — and verify with
        qualified scholars and primary sources.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Data retention</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        Your transcripts, translations, and summaries are kept until you delete
        them — individually (delete a session) or all at once (delete your
        account). Deleting your account permanently removes your sessions and
        user record; this cannot be undone.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Your rights</h2>
      <ul style={styles.ul}>
        <li>
          <strong>Access &amp; export:</strong> view all your sessions in the
          History tab, or export any session as Markdown from its detail page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deletion:</strong> tap your avatar → &quot;Delete account&quot;
          to permanently remove your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Correction &amp; questions:</strong> email{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`} style={{ color: COLORS.accent }}>

          laws such as the GDPR or CCPA; contact us to exercise them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Security</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        Data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/WSS). Your transcripts are
        accessible only through your authenticated account. No system is
        perfectly secure, but we use reputable infrastructure providers and
        limit access to your data.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>International transfers</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        Our processors are based primarily in the United States, so your data
        may be processed there. By using the Service, you consent to this
        transfer and processing.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Cookies</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        We use cookies only to keep you signed in (authentication). We do not
        use advertising or cross-site tracking cookies. Our analytics (Vercel)
        measures aggregate page views without cookies.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Children</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        Tarjuman is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child
        has provided us personal information, contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.h2}>Changes</h2>
      <p style={styles.p}>
        We may update this policy from time to time. The &quot;Last updated&quot;
        date reflects the most recent change; material changes will be
        communicated via the email associated with your account.
